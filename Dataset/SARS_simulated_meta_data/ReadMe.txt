The viral metagenomic dataset containing Influenza (NC_002023.1), hepatitis C virus (HCV, NC_004102.1), and 5 SARS-CoV haplotypes, was simulated. The SARS-CoV haplotypes were created from the SARS-CoV reference (NC 004718.3) genome by mutating bases at randomly selected locations. The sequence similarity between any two haplotypes is above 96%. The abundance of each haplotype is calculated based on a power law equation. The total sequencing depths for the 5 SARS-CoV haplotypes are 1000-x, with 438-x, 219-x, 146-x, 109-x, and 88-x for each haplotype, respectively. The sequencing depths for Influenza and HBV are 700-x and 300-x, respectively. All the data sets were simulated by ART-illumina [31] as error-containing MiSeq paired-end reads, with the read length of 250 bp, the average insert size of 600 bp, and the standard deviation of 150 bp. In total, there are 173,703 simulated reads, of which 119,002 reads are from the five SARS-CoV haplotypes.
